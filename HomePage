<h1> Welcome To My Eportfolio </h1>
<h2>Hello My name is Mitchell Aube' Welcome to my EPortfolio!</h2>
<p id="size">This EPortfolio contains my Resume which displays basic information about me, Mitchell Aube.  I work at Panera Bread Company while I am an online student in my junior year at Southern New Hampshire University.  My major is Information Technology - Cyber Security.  My current GPA is 3.77.</p>

<p>This EPortfolio provides class descriptions for the IT classes I have taken, business classes as well as IT classes I will be taking this upcoming winter and spring.  Also included are samples of my work from major class projects.</p>

<p>When I am not studying or working, I enjoy baking bread, cakes, cookies, and other made from scratch delicious treats.  I like to experiment with new recipes to hone my craft and often bring my latest creation to share with my Panera co-workers.  It is a great feeling to make others smile with home baked goods.</p>
